### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ I have been working as a Software Development Engineer for around 4 years and it's a great journey so far.
    Developing windows applications using C#, .Net.
    
ğŸŒ± I'm also learning Flutter in the meantime.

ğŸ¤” I also get my hands dirty on competitive coding sometimes.
